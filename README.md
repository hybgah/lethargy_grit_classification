Identifying Latent Profiles of Academic Motivation Among Adolescents and Predicting Motivational Types Using Machine Learning
## Overview
This study aimed to identify distinct profiles of academic motivation among adolescents and explore key predictive factors using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) and machine learning techniques. Data were drawn from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS 2018), including a sample of 2,468 first-year middle school students. Grit and academic helplessness were used as core variables to classify motivational types. <br>
LPA revealed three latent profiles:<br>

1. Grit–Moderate Helplessness Type (62.11%), <br>

2. High Grit Type (29.57%), and <br>

3. High Helplessness Type (8.31%). <br>


Subsequently, various machine learning models—including decision trees, ensemble methods (bagging, boosting), random forests, and support vector machines (SVM)—were applied to predict these motivational profiles. Among all predictors, attention span and self-esteem emerged as the most significant variables. Relationships with teachers, parenting attitudes, and peer relationships also contributed to model performance, whereas gender, private tutoring, and poverty status had relatively low predictive importance.

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 0.74. However, most models showed strong predictive performance for Class 1 (Grit–Moderate Helplessness) and limited accuracy in predicting Class 3 (High Helplessness). These findings highlight critical factors influencing adolescent academic motivation and suggest implications for mitigating academic helplessness and promoting positive motivation. The study also demonstrates the potential of machine learning in developing personalized educational support systems. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.
